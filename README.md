The folder contains a model.pt check point file which contains the model used.
A jupyter notebook is attached alongside with sepearte secctions to train and test the model.

A Convolutional Neural Network has been used to achieve the task of classifying flowers into 102 different classes. A Densenet network has been loaded from the pytorch library and modified upon to fit the given training set.

After training the accuracy was about 78-83%
